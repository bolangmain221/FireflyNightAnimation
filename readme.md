Firefly Night Animation
This project creates a mesmerizing animation of fireflies dancing in the night sky using JavaScript.

Description
The animation simulates fireflies moving randomly within the boundaries of a canvas. Each firefly is represented as a glowing dot, and their movement creates a captivating effect reminiscent of fireflies on a warm summer night.

Features
Randomized movement: Each firefly moves in a random direction
within the canvas, creating a natural and organic motion.

Boundary detection: Fireflies bounce off the edges of the canvas, ensuring they stay within the visible area.
Smooth animation: The animation loop ensures a seamless and fluid movement of the fireflies, enhancing the visual appeal.
Usage

How to Customize
You can customize various aspects of the animation by modifying parameters in the JavaScript code:

Number of fireflies: Adjust the quantity of fireflies generated in the init() function.
Firefly appearance: Change the size, color, and glow effect of the fireflies in the Firefly class constructor.
